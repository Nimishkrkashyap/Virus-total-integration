# üõ°Ô∏è IP Reputation Monitoring API

This Node.js service integrates with [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to detect, store, and report potentially malicious IP addresses. It includes endpoints for fetching IP data, sending reports via email, and combining both in an automated pipeline.
